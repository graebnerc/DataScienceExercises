# 'An introduction to data science in R' - Exercises

This package contains exercises accompanying the course
'An introduction to data science in R' taught by Claudius Gr√§bner-Radkowitsch
in the spring semester 2022 at the Europa University Flensburg.

You should install this package via 

```
remotes::install_github(repo = "graebnerc/DataScienceExercises")
```

Then you can complete exercises by calling the following command:

```
learnr::run_tutorial("name_of_exercise_sheet", package = "DataScienceExercises")
```

I recommend clicking on 'Open in browser' to complete the exercises in your 
browser.

You get information about the relevant names of the exercises via the course
homepage. The first exercise sheet, for instance, is called "Basics" and is
called by:

```
learnr::run_tutorial("Basics", package = "DataScienceExercises")
```
