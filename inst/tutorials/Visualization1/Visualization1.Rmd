## Coding exercise - Part 1

**Note:** 
*Automated feedback does not yet work well with visualization tasks.*
*Thus, for some exercises you must compare your result with the solution*
*yourself. These are the exercises that are lacking the `Submit Answer` button.*

The following data set called `nycflights21_small` contains information about
flights from the New York City airports in 2021.

```{r}
head(nycflights21_small)
```

The columns mean the following:

* `dep_delay`, `arr_delay`: Departure and arrival delays, in minutes. Negative times * represent early departures/arrivals.
* `month`: Month of departure.
* `carrier`: Two letter carrier abbreviation.
* `distance`: Distance between airports, in miles.

Start by producing a very simple plot where you simply take the data set, and
represent the relationship between `arr_delay` and `dep_delay` using a 
scatterplot. Here, `arr_delay` should go on the y-axis, `dep_delay` on 
the x-axis.

```{r ex-vis1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis1-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = ____, 
  mapping = ____
  ) +
  geom_____()
```

```{r ex-vis1-hint-2}
ggplot(
  data = ____, 
  mapping = aes(____)
  ) +
  geom_____()
```

```{r ex-vis1-hint-3}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=____, y=____)
  ) +
  geom____()
```

```{r ex-vis1-hint-4}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=dep_delay, y_____)
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r ex-vis1-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=dep_delay, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r ex-vis1-check}
grade_this({
  fail_if(!ggcheck::is_ggplot(.result), 
          message = paste0(
            "You did not define a `ggplot` object. Use the function ",
            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_geoms(.result, "point", exact = FALSE), 
          message = paste0(
            "To produce a scatterplot you must use the geom 'point'."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should use the data set `nycflights21_small`. You can pass ",
            "it to the argument `data` of `ggplot2::ggplot()`."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_mappings(.result, aes(x=dep_delay, y=arr_delay), exact = TRUE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should map the variable `dep_delay` to the x-axis, and the ",
            "variable `arr_delay` to the y-axis! Use the argument `mapping` ",
            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  pass()
}
)
```

Create the same plot as in the exercise before, but (1) map the variable `carrier`
to the aesthetic 'color', and (2) make sure the points have a transparency of 50%.

            "transparency within the geom call. Google the relevant aesthetic!"
            )
          )
  pass()
})
```

Assume the plot from the previous exercise was saved with the name `plot_1`.
Adjust the following labels:

* Title should be: "Delays in departure and arrival in 2021"
* Title of x-axis should be: "Departure delay (in min.)"
* Title of y-axis should be: "Arrival delay (in min.)"
* Caption should be: "Data: anyflights package."

Again, assume the plot from the previous exercise is saved as `plot_1`.
Now adjust the x- and y-axis labels: they should be divided by 1000, and a 
suffix 'k' should be added.

## Coding exercise - Part 2

Let us now study how arrival delays are distributed over the year.
To this end, produce a plot by mapping the variable `month` to the x-axis, and
the variable `arr_delay` to the y axis. The data should be represented via the
point-geom. Also apply the black-and-white theme.

            "Use the argument `mapping` ",
            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  pass()
})
```

One way to represent distributions with more information is to use a 
[boxplot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html). 
You can do this by replacing the geom 'point' with the geom 'boxplot'.

```{r ex-vis7, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis7-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  ____() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis7-hint-2}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_____() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis7-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis7-check}
grade_this({
  fail_if(!ggcheck::is_ggplot(.result), 
          message = paste0(
            "You did not define a `ggplot` object. Use the function ",
            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_geoms(.result, "boxplot", exact = FALSE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You were asked to use the geom 'boxplot'."
            ), encourage = TRUE
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should use the data set `nycflights21_small`. You can pass ",
            "it to the argument `data` of `ggplot2::ggplot()`."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_mappings(.result, aes(x=month, y = arr_delay), 
                         exact = TRUE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should map the variable `month` to the x-axis, and the ",
            "variable `arr_delay` to the y-axis!" ,
            "Use the argument `mapping` ",
            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  pass()
})
```

One problem with boxplots is that they may conceal the underlying distribution 
of the data. A neat alternative is the 
[violin plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html). 
Replace the boxplot with the geom needed for a violin plot.


```{r ex-vis8, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis8-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_____() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis8-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis8-check}
grade_this({
  fail_if(!ggcheck::is_ggplot(.result), 
          message = paste0(
            "You did not define a `ggplot` object. Use the function ",
            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_geoms(.result, "violin", exact = FALSE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You were asked to use the geom 'violin'."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should use the data set `nycflights21_small`. You can pass ",
            "it to the argument `data` of `ggplot2::ggplot()`."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_mappings(.result, aes(x=month, y = arr_delay), 
                         exact = TRUE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should map the variable `month` to the x-axis, and the ",
            "variable `arr_delay` to the y-axis!" ,
            "Use the argument `mapping` ",
            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  pass()
})
```

Redo the previous plot but set the optional argument for the violin geom
`scale` to `'count'`. Can you guess what it does?

```{r ex-vis9, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis9-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_violin(____) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis9-hint-2}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_violin(scale = ____) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis9-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x=month, y = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_violin(scale = "count") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis9-check}
grade_this({
  fail_if(!ggcheck::is_ggplot(.result), 
          message = paste0(
            "You did not define a `ggplot` object. Use the function ",
            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should use the data set `nycflights21_small`. You can pass ",
            "it to the argument `data` of `ggplot2::ggplot()`."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_mappings(.result, aes(x=month, y = arr_delay), 
                         exact = TRUE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should map the variable `month` to the x-axis, and the ",
            "variable `arr_delay` to the y-axis!" ,

            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_geoms(.result, "violin", exact = FALSE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You were asked to use the geom 'violin'."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_geom_params(.result, "violin", list(scale = "count")), 
          message = paste0(
            "You forgot the set the optional argument `scale` for the violin ",
            "geom to `'count`. Google can help you to find out what to do!"
            )
          )
  pass(message = paste0("Great job! As you can see the specification ",
                        "`scale = 'count'` is useful to highlight differences ",
                        "in the sizes of the different groups that otherwise ",
                        "might remain unnoticed!"))
})
```

Finally, lets look at the distribution of delays. We might do this using a
histogram. Create a histogram of the arrival delays.

**Hint:** *you now need to specify a single axis, since you are representing *
*only the distribution of a single variable.*

```{r ex-vis10, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis10-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(____)
  ) +
  ____() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis10-hint-2}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x = ____)
  ) +
  ____() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis10-hint-3}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x = ____)
  ) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis10-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis10-check}
grade_this({

          message = paste0(

            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small), 
          message = paste0(
            "You should use the data set `nycflights21_small`. You can pass ",
            "it to the argument `data` of `ggplot2::ggplot()`."
            )
          )
  fail_if(!uses_mappings(.result, aes(x=arr_delay), 
                         exact = TRUE), 
          message = paste0(
            "There is a problem with your mapping. You only need one variable " ,
            "this time. Think about which axis it would make sense to plot it ",
            "onto. As usual, use the argument `mapping` ",
            "of the `ggplot2::ggplot()` function, as well as `ggplot2::aes()`."
            )
          )  
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_geoms(.result, "histogram", exact = FALSE), 
          message = paste0(
            "You must produce a histogram. What geom could be the right one?"
            )
          )
  pass()
})
```

Re-create this histogram from above, but set the width of the histogram bins
to `10`.

```{r ex-vis11, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ex-vis11-hint-1}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small,

  mapping = aes(x = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_histogram(____ = 10) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ex-vis11-solution}
ggplot(
  data = nycflights21_small, 
  mapping = aes(x = arr_delay)
  ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +

```

            "`ggplot2::ggplot()`. ",
            "Did you maybe forget to call and render the plot?"
            )
          )
  fail_if(!ggcheck::uses_data(.result, nycflights21_small),

            "a good idea to google how to set the binwidth (not the nb of bins!)!"
