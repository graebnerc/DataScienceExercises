## General remarks

* There will be no coding exercises in the exercise sheet; you can find a link 
to coding exercises in the material section of the course homepage
* The questions and practical tasks all refer to *Quarto*; for a tutorial 
on Markdown (that also includes exercises), please use the 
[CommonMark markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)

Consider the following header:

```
title: "Test Markdown"
author: "Claudius"
format: 
  html: 
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 2
    toc-location: body
    number-sections: true
    theme: darkly
  pdf:
    number-sections: true
```

```{r markdownquiz2}

  question(
    "Will the rendered document feature a table of contents?",
    answer("Only if you produce an html file", correct = TRUE),

    answer(paste0("It changes the overall appearence of the resulting file ",
                  "according to a Quarto-theme"), correct = TRUE),
    answer("It chooses a combination of fonts that give a dark appearance"),
    answer("It darkens your code in the resulting html file"),
    answer("It chooses a dark color-coding of the code for your editor"),
    allow_retry = TRUE, random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

Consider the following two chunk options:

A)
```
{r, label="make-plot", echo=FALSE, fig.with=8, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="A nice plot"}
```

B)

```
{r}
#| label: make-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "A nice plot"
```
